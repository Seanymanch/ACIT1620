    <body><h1>The First Lab of the Class</h1>
    <p>This is the <strong>first paragraph</strong> for the first lab of the class. I am very excited to learn more about coding and web technologies!</p>
    <em><h4>I don't have any experience is coding, so this course will be very beneficial for me in this program.</h4></em>
<br>
<p>This is the <strong>second paragraph</strong> in the first lab of the class. I was having some issues porting this file to github, but I have seemed to get it sorted out.</p>
